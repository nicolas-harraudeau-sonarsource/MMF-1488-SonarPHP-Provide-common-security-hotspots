=== TODO LATER ===

* CodeIgniter:
see: https://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/libraries/encryption.html
The following is for now ignored. It should generate later a vulnerability as encryption keys should not be hard coded.
$config['encryption_key'] = "bla"; // Questionable

* Laravel
see: https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/encryption#configuration
password should not be commited to repo
see "key" option in config/app.php

* Magento
see: https://www.magevision.com/blog/post/decrypt-an-encrypted-config-value-magento-2/
It is not clear yet what should raise an issue. More research needed.
